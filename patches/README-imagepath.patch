 # API Requests
- In our case, REST API requests need to be build by combining the following components. <table> <tr> <th><b>Component</b></th> <th><b>Description</b></th> </tr> <tr> <td>HTTP-Methods</td> <td> <ul> <li>GET (retrieve a resource)</li> <li>POST (create a resource)</li> <li>PUT (update a resource)</li> <li>DELETE (delete a resource)</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>URL of the API</td> <td><span style='color: #2aa198'>ht</span><span style='color: #2aa198'>tps://my.sevdesk.de/api/v1</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td>URI of the resource</td> <td>The resource to query.<br>For example contacts in sevdesk:<br><br> <span style='color:red'>/Contact</span><br><br> Which will result in the following complete URL:<br><br> <span style='color: #2aa198'>ht</span><span style='color: #2aa198'>tps://my.sevdesk.de/api/v1</span><span style='color:red'>/Contact</span> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Query parameters</td> <td>Are attached by using the connectives <b>?</b> and <b>&</b> in the URL.<br></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Request headers</td> <td>Typical request headers are for example:<br> <div> <br> <ul> <li>Content-type</li> <li>Authorization</li> <li>Accept-Encoding</li> <li>User-Agent</li> <li>X-Version: Used for resource versioning see information below</li> <li>...</li> </ul> </div> </td> </tr> <tr>  <td>Response headers</td> <td> Typical response headers are for example:<br><br> <div> <ul>  <li>Deprecation: If a resource is deprecated we return true or a timestamp since when</li> <li>...</li> </ul> </div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Request body</td> <td>Mostly required in POST and PUT requests.<br> Often the request body contains json, in our case, it also accepts url-encoded data. </td> </tr> </table><br> <span style='color:red'>Note</span>: please pass a meaningful entry at the header \"User-Agent\".

 <b>Pagination</b><br> <p>This API implements pagination to help you efficiently manage large result sets. Instead of retrieving all records at once, you can request specific subsets of data using the following parameters.</p> <table> <tr> <th><b>Parameter</b></th> <th><b>Type</b></th> <th><b>Description</b></th> </tr> <tr> <td>limit</td> <td>Integer</td> <td>Limits the number of entries that are returned.<br> Most useful in GET requests which will most likely deliver big sets of data like country or currency lists.<br> The limit must be between 1 and 1000. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>offset</td> <td>Integer</td> <td>Specifies a certain offset for the data that will be returned.<br> As an example, you can specify \"offset=2\" if you want all entries except for the first two.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>countAll</td> <td>Boolean</td> <td>When set to <code>true</code>, the response will include the total count of available records. Defaults to <code>false</code>.</td> </tr> </table> <br> <b>How Pagination Works</b><br>
 <ol> <li>The limit parameter determines how many records will be included in each response</li> <li>The offset parameter indicates how many records to skip before beginning to return results</li> <li>When countAll=true is specified, the response will include a total field with the complete count of available records</li> </ol>
 <b>Example Usage:</b><br> <b>Basic Request</b><br> <ul><li><code>ht<span>tps://my.sevdesk.de/api/v1/Invoice?limit=10&offset=0<span></code></li></ul> <p>This returns the first 10 resources.</p><br>

 # Your First Request
  After reading the introduction to our API, you should now be able to make your first call.<br> For testing our API, we would always recommend to create a trial account for sevdesk to prevent unwanted changes to your main account.<br> A trial account will be in the highest tariff (materials management), so every sevdesk function can be tested! 
 
-To start testing we would recommend one of the following tools: <ul> <li><a href='https://www.getpostman.com/'>Postman</a></li> <li><a href='https://curl.haxx.se/download.html'>cURL</a></li> </ul> This example will illustrate your first request, which is creating a new Contact in sevdesk.<br> <ol> <li>Download <a href='https://www.getpostman.com/'><b>Postman</b></a> for your desired system and start the application</li> <li>Enter <span><b>ht</span>tps://my.sevdesk.de/api/v1/Contact</b> as the url</li> <li>Create an authorization header and insert your API token as the value</li> <li>For this test, select <b>POST</b> as the HTTP method</li> <li>Go to <b>Headers</b> and enter the key-value pair <b>Content-type</b> + <b>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</b><br> As an alternative, you can just go to <b>Body</b> and select <b>x-www-form-urlencoded</b></li> <li>Now go to <b>Body</b> (if you are not there yet) and enter the key-value pairs as shown in the following picture<br><br> <img src='openAPI/img/FirstRequestPostman.PNG' width='900'><br><br></li> <li>Click on <b>Send</b>. Your response should now look like this:<br><br> <img src='openAPI/img/FirstRequestResponse.PNG' width='900'></li> </ol> As you can see, a successful response in this case returns a JSON-formatted response body containing the contact you just created.<br> For keeping it simple, this was only a minimal example of creating a contact.<br> There are however numerous combinations of parameters that you can provide which add information to your contact.

 # sevdesk-Update 2.0
  Started in 2024 we introduced a new era of bookkeeping in sevdesk. You can check if you already received the update by clicking on your profile in the top right in the sevdesk WebApp or by using the [Tools/bookkeepingSystemVersion endpoint](#tag/Basics/operation/bookkeepingSystemVersion).<br> The old version will be available for some customers until the end of 2024. In this short list we have outlined the changed endpoints with links to jump to the descriptions. If you received the [api newsletter](https://landing.sevdesk.de/api-newsletter) you already know what changed. Otherwise you can check the api changes [here](https://tech.sevdesk.com/api_news/posts/2024_04_04-system-update-breaking-changes/).
